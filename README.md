A minimalist Java library for effortless unit test execution. Although functional, my main goal was to put my studies on annotation and reflection in Java into practice. It was also a fun challenge to develop a test library from scratch and without references.

## How does it work? 💡
UVATester's main process can be summarized as follows:
- Receiving the name of a test class, loading it dynamically via reflection.
- Checking that the class has the `@TestClass` annotation.
- Invoking each method in the class that has the `@TestMethod` annotation and follows certain criteria (for more details, see the "Mapping process" section).
- If any problems occur during the execution of the tests, the details of the error will be logged and then the UVATester will be terminated.

## Requirements 🔗
<b>Mandatory</b>:
- Java 17+
- Maven 4.0.0+

<b>Optional</b>:
- JitPack

## Quick usage guide 📚
#### Installation:
Add and download the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.foiovituh</groupId>
        <artifactId>uva-tester</artifactId>
        <version>v1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

---

#### Mapping process:
Annotate your test class with `@TestClass`, and annotate your test methods with `@TestMethod`. The test methods should be static, return void, and have no arguments. For example:

```java
@TestClass
public class ShoppingTrolleyTest {
    @TestMethod
    public static void testEmptyShoppingTrolleyGuardingReturnsTrue() {
    	final var shoppingTrolley = new ShoppingTrolley();
    	
    	final var testName = "testEmptyShoppingTrolleyGuardingReturnsTrue";
        final var testResult = shoppingTrolley.guardShoppingTrolley()
        		&& Assertor.isNullOrEmpty(shoppingTrolley.getItems())
        			? "pass"
        			: "failed";
        
        Feedback.showResult(testName, testResult);
    }
}
```

---

#### Execution:
Instantiate a `UVATester` object using the test class name and invoke its `run()` method to execute all defined tests:
```java
public class ShoppingTrolleyTestExecutor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final var shoppingTrolleyTests = new UVATester(
                ShoppingTrolleyTest.class.getName()
        );
        
        shoppingTrolleyTests.run();
    }
}
```

---

#### Assertor:
You can also use assertion methods that can be useful when developing tests. They are available in the class: `com.github.foiovituh.uvatester.utils.Assertor`. For example, the method:
```java
public static boolean isWithinRange(int value, int min, int max) {
    return value >= min && value <= max;
}
```

## Future plans 📌
- Add more methods to the Assertor class
- Make it optional to close tests if one fails
